#Basic Principles and Models
This notebook 

## Part 1 
Breast cancer tabular dataframe is created with Pandas. Features and targets are explored using pandas. Data set is splitted into train and test set . Effect of standarisation is observed on the distribution of data.

## Part 2 : KNN Classifier without Standardisation
1. KNN classifier is trained using 5-fold cross validation on the dataset. 
2. Hyperparameter K (No of neighbours) is tuned based on mean-cross validation accuracy.
3. Overfitting and underfitting is observed.
